# dice-roll
Hi there ! This is my first repository

So, here we have to write a code for a dice-roll game. Two dices will be rolled and we to display the numbers on both of them. When the two sixes show up,display the message and the number of turns it took
 
 OUTPUT SHOULD BE LIKE:
Rolls: 6 , 2
Rolls: 6 , 1
Rolls: 2 , 3
Rolls: 2 , 2
Rolls: 6 , 1
Rolls: 3 , 2
Rolls: 1 , 1
Rolls: 6 , 6
HEYA! U GOT TWO SIXES
U got two sixes in 8 turns
