Hi there ! 

So, here we have to write a code for a dice-roll game. Two dices will be rolled and we to display the numbers on both of them. When the two sixes show up,display the message and the number of turns it took
 
 OUTPUT FOR THE CODE WRITTEN IN FILE code.py WILL BE SOMEWHAT LIKE THIS:
Rolls: 6 , 2
Rolls: 6 , 1
Rolls: 2 , 3
Rolls: 2 , 2
Rolls: 6 , 1
Rolls: 3 , 2
Rolls: 1 , 1
Rolls: 6 , 6
HEYA! U GOT TWO SIXES
